          In the third year of computer science engineering, students navigate a
          comprehensive curriculum that delves into the intricate realms of
          Microprocessor architecture, Advanced Database Management Systems
          (DBMS), Compiler design, and Networks. The exploration of
          Microprocessor architecture equips students with a profound
          understanding of designing and programming microprocessor-based
          systems, bridging the gap between hardware and software. Concurrently,
          the Advanced DBMS course empowers students with advanced concepts in
          data organization and retrieval, fostering the skills necessary for
          efficiently managing expansive datasets. Alongside, Compiler design
          unfolds the complexities of language translation and compilation
          processes, enriching students with the theoretical foundations
          essential for crafting efficient compilers. Networks, another
          cornerstone, explores the principles of computer networking, covering
          protocols, routing, and security, preparing students for roles in
          network administration and cybersecurity.
